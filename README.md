## Embarking on a Journey to Illuminate Alzheimer's Disease: Early Detection and Multidisciplinary Insights".  

After conducting extensive research on various diseases, we have decided to concentrate our efforts on Alzheimer's disease prediction. We've chosen to focus on Alzheimer's disease prediction, not only due to its significance but also because it provides an excellent platform for learning and exploring cutting-edge machine learning techniques. Early detection is critical for this progressive condition affecting memory and cognition. Our research spans diverse fields, including neuroscience, genetics, data science, and healthcare, enabling us to develop and apply state-of-the-art ML techniques. With a growing aging population, our work carries substantial societal impact and may lead to improved diagnostic tools. Our mission is to advance early detection and management of Alzheimer's, all while gaining valuable insights into the world of machine learning.

## Week-2
### Engaging in the exploration of various datasets related to Alzheimer's Disease and thoroughly reviewing a wide range of research papers.
##### We have identified several research papers that offer valuable insights into Alzheimer's disease, providing an opportunity to delve deeper into this topic.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers    

We performed an extensive analysis of the dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers, including in-depth exploratory data analysis and rigorous data preprocessing. Subsequently, we applied a variety of machine learning algorithms to create predictive models ,the accuracys are shown in the below graph. Our objective was to leverage this dataset to make informed decisions and predictions in the field of Alzheimer's research.

## week-3
To enhance the robustness of our machine learning model for early Alzheimer's prediction, we aim to broaden our dataset exploration. We seek additional datasets pertaining to Alzheimer's disease, with the objective of enriching our model's performance and accuracy. By expanding our data sources, we aim to create a more comprehensive and reliable predictive tool for early Alzheimer's detection.

As part of our dataset expansion strategy, we have chosen to include the Alzheimer's Image Dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset consists of images classified into four distinct classes related to Alzheimer's disease.

We have selected the below image dataset due to its potential to offer valuable visual insights into Alzheimer's disease progression. By integrating visual data alongside structured data, we anticipate a more comprehensive understanding of the condition, leading to improved predictive performance.
