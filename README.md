## Embarking on a Journey to Illuminate Alzheimer's Disease: Early Detection and Multidisciplinary Insights".  

After conducting extensive research on various diseases, we have decided to concentrate our efforts on Alzheimer's disease prediction. We've chosen to focus on Alzheimer's disease prediction, not only due to its significance but also because it provides an excellent platform for learning and exploring cutting-edge machine learning techniques. Early detection is critical for this progressive condition affecting memory and cognition. Our research spans diverse fields, including neuroscience, genetics, data science, and healthcare, enabling us to develop and apply state-of-the-art ML techniques. With a growing aging population, our work carries substantial societal impact and may lead to improved diagnostic tools. Our mission is to advance early detection and management of Alzheimer's, all while gaining valuable insights into the world of machine learning.

## Week-2
### Engaging in the exploration of various datasets related to Alzheimer's Disease and thoroughly reviewing a wide range of research papers.
##### We have identified several research papers that offer valuable insights into Alzheimer's disease, providing an opportunity to delve deeper into this topic.
